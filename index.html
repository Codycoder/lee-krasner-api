      I found Krasner through Jackson Pollock's art; ultimately she has proven to be far more interesting to me. She was level-headed and hard-working. She didn't want to have children because she wanted Pollock to have full opportunity to work on his paintings. They moved to Long Island to get away from the party scene in Manhattan and neither did art for a year; instead they spent that time fixing up their farmhouse and making their own furniture (!!). Often she would take her own work and cut it into pieces and then make new pieces with those fragments. Krasner also destroyed much of her work. Her tenacity interests me; the way she continually destroyed and reassembled her work from the pieces. She took care of the person she loved until he destroyed himself and then she continued on.
